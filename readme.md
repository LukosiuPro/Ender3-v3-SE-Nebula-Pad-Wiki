## Working On This Repository
This project uses [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to build a static website. The maintainers have attempted to make it very easy to work with on your own system.

All you need to work with these files is a text editor and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

To get a local copy running, clone this repository to your local computer. Inside the repository, run `uv sync`. This will download a copy of MKDocs and any other themes or plugins used by this project. To browse the created website locally, you can then run `uv run mkdocs serve`. This will start a local webserver that will automatically update the content of the docs as you edit them.

When you're done with your changes, simply commit them and push them up to your repo, and then you can create a pull request to have them added.
