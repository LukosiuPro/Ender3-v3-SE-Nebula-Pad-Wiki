## Getting Started

!!! danger "At Your Own Risk"
    3D FDM printers involve high temperatures, molten plastic, and electricity. Improperly done modifications may not
    only break your printer but may cause damage, personal harm, or death. Any modifications you make are at your own
    risk. Please make sure to follow all [safety](safety.md) notes and your own common sense when working on your
    printer.

To get started, you should follow the following topics in order:

1. [Setup the Nebula Pad](setup-nebula-pad/index.md)
2. [Rooting the Nebula Pad](rooting/index.md)
3. [Applying Post-Root Fixes](rooting/fixes/index.md)

After those tasks, or if you just want to see what's available, you can select a topic from the menu.
