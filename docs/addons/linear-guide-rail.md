# Creality Ender-3 V3 SE Linear Guide Rail Kit

The official guide rail kit replaces the wheel-based X-axis movement with a linear rail like the KE has. While not identical, due to the differences in the hotend, it works the same way.

## Kit Contents
The kit includes the following parts:

1. Linear guide rail and rail mounting plate
2. Backplate
3. M3x6 and M3x10 hex screws
4. T-nuts
5. Allen wrenches and multifunction wrench
6. Lubricant grease

## Installation Steps

!!! tip "Tips"
    - You will be needing to remove quite a few parts to do this installation. Multiple screws and sizes of screws are involved. Make note of what screws go where so you don't mix them up on reinstall. Taking photos while you work is a good practice to keep things straight.
    - If you haven't worked on your printer before, you will see little blobs on the wire connectors. This is hot glue used to keep the wires from loosening during shipping. You can carefully peel these off using a tweezer designed for electronics or using a bit of isopropyl alcohol to loosen the glue. If you have a hairdryer or heat gun, you can _lightly_ heat up the area to make the glue a bit easier to pull off. If you use heat, be careful not to overheat the area as it could melt the connectors or damage the circuit boards.

1. Remove the full hotend from the stock backplate
    1. Unscrew the cover. There are two screws on the right and one on the left.
    2. Unscrew the extruder assembly. It is attached with four screws on the right.
    3. Remove the extruder. It's attached with two screws on the front near the top of the heatsink.
    4. Unscrew the hotend circuit board. It uses two screws at the top and one lower down between two connectors.
    5. Remove the backplate
        1. Loosen the belt using the screw on the right endcap of the x axis bar, and then slide the ends of the belt out of the slots in the backplate. Do _not_ remove the belt entirely, just let the ends hang down.
        2. Unscrew the wheels from the backplate. You can use one of the included allen wrenches on the head and the multifunction wrench on the nut at the back.
2. Install the guide rail
    1. With the sliding piece in the center of the guide rail, remove the plastic endcaps. These are usually blue. They are only used in shipping to keep the slider from detaching from the rail.
    2. Use the M3x10 screws and T-nuts to fasten the rail and the mounting plate together. When installing, make sure a screw is in each of the very outer holes and skip every other hole. Do not fully tighten the parts.
    3. Place the parts on the top of the X axis bar. The mounting plate has notches on one side to help with orientation. The side with the notches should be toward the back with the longer notch at the right.
    4. Tighten the screws. This will spin the T-nuts to lock them into the axis bar and affix everything firmly.
3. Install the new backplate
    1. Use the included screws to attach the new backplate to the slider on the rail.
    2. Reattach the belt to the new backplate by sliding the ends into the slots in much the same way as you removed it from the old one.
    3. Tighten the x axis belt by using the screw on the right endcap. It should be firm but not overly tight. You can do further tension adjustments after everything is fully reassembled.
4. Reassemble the hotend by reversing the process in step 1.

## References
Although there is no official video, a few other parties have made decent videos. Unfortunately, they don't follow the correct screw spacing for the rail. Make sure to check the manual for the correct screw locations.

- [Installation video by Prapat s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NQvPfC3OaQ) - Good overview, but one **major issue**. The installer does not remove the blue plastic stops that are only for shipping. Check the install manual for the correct screw locations in the linear rail.
- [Installation video by Red Dot Geek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9OwPqOlRWE) - Also a good overview, but a similar **major issue**. They do not put the screws in the correct spots. The screws should be installed evenly down the bar as shown in the installation manual.
