# Post-Root Fixes for Nebula Pad

!!! warning "At Your Own Risk"
    The following changes require editing the printer configuration files on the Nebula Pad. As these configuration files adjust how the printer hardware works, bad edits may break your hardware or cause other [safety](../../safety.md) issues. **Make sure to read the full process before starting and follow each step closely.**

## Requirements
Before you can implement these fixes, you must have the following things completed:

- [Nebula Pad set up](../../setup-nebula-pad/index.md) and working on your printer
- [Rooted](../index.md) Nebula Pad
- Fluidd installed on the Nebula Pad <small>(this is set up if you followed the rooting document exactly)</small>

## Tweaks
- [Fixing layer shift and nozzle grinding](adjust-run-current.md) (adjusting the run current)
- [Lowering Max Print Speed](limiting-speed.md)
