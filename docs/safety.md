# Safety Notice

:warning: **All modifications to your printer are done at your own risk.** :warning:

It is important to keep in mind that 3D FDM printers like the Ender-3 series deal with high temperatures, molten plastic, and high voltages in some areas. Improperly done modifications may not only break your printer, but could [present a fire risk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK_K6fp4BIk) and cause damage, personal harm, or even death.

While these documents try to provide tested advice, there is still risk in any modification. The authors of these documents are not responsible for any damages resulting from any modification you do to your printer following the guides.

When using your printer, even without modifications, you should keep it under supervision and *never* leave it unattended for any length of time.
