# Fixes For Nebula Pad after root

## IMPORTANT!!!
In this tutorial you will have to do some adjustments in printer config, **make sure to read all the steps closely**,
as these changes involve changing hardware settings,
which can break your printer if you don't follow them and decide to make changes yourself,
I'm not responsible if you make changes that is not told to do. **Follow with caution!!!!!!!**
